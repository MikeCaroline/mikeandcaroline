## How to get to Santa Barbara

* Fly directly into Santa Barbara airport!
  - Rental car options: If you want to avoid airport rental car fees there is another Enterprise rental car location ~0.5 miles from the Santa Barbara Airport (5959 Hollister Ave Ste B, Goleta, CA 93117)

* Fly into Los Angeles (about 90 miles, 1.5-3 hours from SB)
  - If you rent a car from LA, you can enjoy a scenic drive along the coast to Santa Barbara - traffic is usually not bad once you get out of the immediate LAX area.
  - The easiest bus option is the <a href="https://www.sbairbus.com/lax-shuttle-schedule-fares/">SB airbus</a> which goes directly from LAX to various locations around Goleta and Santa Barbara.
  - Other options like Flixbus, Amtrak, and more may offer different price points, routes, and times.

* Pacific Surfliner <a href="https://www.pacificsurfliner.com/">train</a>: we have never taken it but we hear great things!

* Drive up from North, South, East, but probably not West
