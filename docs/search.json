Using MDIBL’s citizen science data platform, Anecdata.org, participants over the age of 18 will be asked to fill out a brief anonymous survey, providing information on symptoms, masking, which kind of test kit was used, and the test result.\nJane Disney, Ph.D., who leads the project said, “It will provide very practical information that will inform our understanding of community spread as SARS CoV-2 and its subvariants continue to infect people worldwide. This survey tool will help us address critical questions about the relationship between timing of exposure, whether a mask was worn, what type of mask was worn, symptoms, and results of different Covid-19 home test kits. The anonymous results are publicly available for download so that people can see what is happening in their communities.”\nThe US government recently provided guidance that requires private insurance companies to cover the costs of up to eight FDA approved over the counter COVID-19 diagnostic tests per household. Therefore, administration of these tests is happening privately, and test results are largely unreported. Disney added, “This leaves a great gap in knowledge about the transmission of the virus. MDIBL is pleased to assist in tracing infections in this way and working on behalf of the public good.”\nIf you are interested in taking part of this Citizen Science project that will provide valuable data to researchers, you can learn more about and participate in the project, [here](https://www.anecdata.org/projects/view/covid-19-home-testing.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Frenchman Bay Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nAbout this project:\nThe Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest heating bodies of water on the planet. With its shallow depth and shape, making it especially susceptible to warming. It is important to monitor the changes in the marine ecosystems to understand how they are currently and may continue to respond to perturbations. This has implications for the marine ecology and fisheries of the region including potentially changes to the timing, type, and intensity of harmful algal blooms (or HABS for short).\nIn Frenchman Bay some species of the dinoflagellates Alexandrium are known to produce a highly potent neurotoxin called saxitoxin. Shellfish filter feed on these microbes and accumulate the toxin and when people eat the toxin filled shellfish it can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. The presence of any Alexandrium can necessitate fisheries closures because of the associated public health risk.\nSimilarly some species of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia can produce a different neurotoxin called domoic acid, which is responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning. When humans, birds, or various marine mammals consume affected shellfish it effects brain function and can cause seizures and in some cases death. In pop-culture a 1961 HAB of Pseudo-nitzschia led seabirds to attach local residents of a shore community and was influential in the creating of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film The Birds\nThe Community Environmental Health Lab has been monitoring the presence and abundance of HAB species and other phytoplankton for over two decades. Currently the data collected are included in a larger HAB monitoring program run through the Maine Department of Marine Resources program. The current HAB target species of concern include:\nAlexandrium\nDinophysis acuminata\nDinophysis norvegica\nGonyaulax\nKarenia\nMargalefidinium polykrikoides (formerly known as Cochlodinium)\nProrocentrum lima\nPseudo-nitzschia\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nMaine Healthy Beaches is “a statewide effort to monitor water quality and protect public health at Maine’s participating coastal saltwater beaches”. Each week, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, volunteers and staff from the Community Environmental Health Lab at MDIBL and Acadia National Park test many of the most popular swim spots on MDI.\nEach sample is collected using EPA-approved quality assured protocols. Samples on MDI are brought to the Community Lab at MDIBL to be analyzed for Enterococcous, a fecal indicator bacteria.\nFecal indicator bacteria are associated with the fecal material from humans and other warm-blooded animals; MHB uses this as an indicator because there are far too many pathogens to test for individually. If Enterococcus is present, then other pathogens are likely present as well.\nPeople can become ill after swallowing or other contact with contaminated water; symptoms are typically gastrointestinal, respiratory, or skin related. According to MHB, moderate to heavy rainfall (1” or more in a 24-hour period) is often associated with an increased risk of bacterial contamination, so precautionary rainfall advisories are posted.\nOther pathogenic sources include:\nImproperly disposed of diapers\nChildren not properly cleaned after using the bathroom\nSwimmers with diarrhea\nA vomiting or fecal accident in the water\nWaste from wildlife, domestic animals, and pets\nMalfunctioning subsurface wastewater disposal (septic) or sanitary collection (sewage treatment plant) systems\nBoats discharging sewage into the water\nContaminated stormwater runoff\nBefore your next beach day, check for beach advisories or closures at participating beaches by visiting the Current Beach Status webpage, or, when you get to the beach, look for the Maine Healthy Beaches sign – advisories and closures will be physically posted.\nThe Community Enivoronmental Health Lab’s related data is also available through our Anecdata portal.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Arsenic levels in drinking water",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nAbout this project:\nMaine and New Hampshire have among the highest per capita reliance on private wells for drinking water in the United States (ME: 56% and NH: 40%). Approximately 10% of Maine wells and 20% of New Hampshire wells have elevated levels of arsenic, yet well water testing rates are low in both states.\nIn August 2018, MDI Biological Laboratory received a 5-year NIH-NIGMS Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) to create and pilot a national model of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education. The project, “Data to Action: A Secondary School-Based Citizen Science Project to Address Arsenic Contamination of Well Water” engages students as citizen scientists and provides them with the tools and skills to make sense of data so that their results can lead to change in their communities. This work will also help the region better understand the cycle of arsenic on agricultural land and in home gardens, and its potential effects on human health, from exposure such as eating produce, touching soil, or breathing in soil dust. You can read more about this project at this recent MDIBL blog post .\nMaximum Contaminant Levels: The numbers below are federal standards set by the EPA for the maximum contaminant amount allowed in drinking water. These are set to protect public health. There are a few exceptions to the Maximum Contaminant Levels.\nBeryllium: 4 ug/L\nChromium: 100 ug/L\nManganese: 50 ug/L**\nIron: 300 ug/L**\nNickel: N/A\nCopper: 1300 ug/L*\nArsenic: 10 ug/L; New Hampshire lowered their MCL to 5 ug/L in 2019.\nSelenium: 50 ug/L\nCadmium: 5 ug/L\nAntimony: 6 ug/L\nBarium: 2000 ug/L\nThallium: 2 ug/L\nLead: 15 ug/L\nUranium: 30 ug/L\n*Lead and Copper are regulated under an action level because they enter drinking water primarily through plumbing materials. Treatment at the tap is recommended.\n**Iron and Manganese are “secondary standards” and not health threatening. The EPA sets these standards because contaminants present in your water above these standards may cause your water to be discolored, taste odd, or have an odor. However, your water is still safe to drink\n\n\n\n",
